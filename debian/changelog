linstaller (1.51.0~pre1-1) emily; urgency=low

  * Added alan extension and its relevant alan-ext-linstaller package
  * New wrapper for linstaller that displays "Press ENTER to close" if
    linstaller has failed (prevents the immediate destroy of the
    terminal window)
  * Added copyright (python-stdeb didn't have created one :/)
  * Added new live-config-linstaller package.
  * partdisks: do not fail if no swap is available/selected
  * partdisks: mount empty partitions that have "useas" correctly defined
  * linstaller.py: read frontend from command-line args, do not use the
    frontend variable on configuration anymore.
    If -f|--frontend is not specified, default to 'cli'
  * config/semplice-base: removed 'frontend' variable
