linstaller - a simple yet powerful gnu/linux installer
------------------------------------------------------

linstaller is a modular and preseedable GNU/Linux distribution
installer, written in python.

It is Semplice Linux-oriented, but thanks to its configuration
system, can be adapted to many Live distributions.

The project's name has three different meanings:
 * LINstaller = LINux installer
 * L'installer = "The installer" in italian
 * L-installer = laiv-installer, which was the name of our
   previous installer.

Make it work
============

linstaller is in the initial developing phase and is not intended
to be used in production.
You need to adjust the configuration path in linstaller/core/config.py:

   configpath = "/home/g7/semplice/emily/INSTALLER_NEW_YAY/config"

should be adjusted to:

   configpath = "/path/to/linstaller/directory/config"

Start
=====

To start linstaller you should use this command:

   sudo ./linstaller.py -c=semplice start

where 'semplice' is the configuration file of the distribution (currently
only semplice is available).
You can symlink 'semplice' to 'default' and not use the -c switch.
